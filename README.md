# aws-python-scripts
This repository will include all of the scripts which I wrote for services in AWS

All these scripts were written by me for work/personal projects in AWS.

Anyone can copy/use these scripts but don't hold me liable if something breaks while using these scripts.

Always get scripts reviewed before running them in PROD :)

Peace to you!
