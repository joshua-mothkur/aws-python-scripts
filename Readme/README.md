# aws-python-scripts
This repository will include some of the scripts which I wrote for interacting with AWS to solve problems in my day to day job.

All these scripts were written by me for work/personal projects in AWS.

Anyone can copy/use these scripts but don't hold me liable if something breaks while using these scripts.

Always get scripts reviewed before running them in PROD :)

Peace to you!
